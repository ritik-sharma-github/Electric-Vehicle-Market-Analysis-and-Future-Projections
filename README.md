### METHODOLOGY

#### Handling Missing Values

This report outlines the process of identifying and handling missing values through exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques. Initial EDA reveals the presence of missing values in the Legislative District and Electric Utility columns. These missing values could stem from various factors such as data collection errors, incomplete records, or system failures.

To address missing values effectively, we employ forward fill and backward fill techniques:

1. **Forward Fill (ffill)**:
   - This approach involves filling missing values with the most recent known value preceding the missing data point.
   - In the context of electric vehicles, applying forward fill to the Legislative District and Electric Utility columns propagates the last observed values forward, ensuring continuity in the dataset.

2. **Backward Fill (bfill)**:
   - Backward fill entails filling missing values with the next known value following the missing data point.
   - Leveraging backward fill ensures that missing values are replaced with subsequent valid entries, maintaining data integrity and coherence.

3. **Regression Analysis**:
   - Regression analysis allows us to predict missing values based on relationships with other variables.
   - By building a regression model using non-missing data, we can impute missing values more accurately.

4. **Mode and Mean Imputation**:
   - For the County, City, and Postal Code columns, we use mode imputation to fill missing values.
   - Mode imputation involves replacing missing values with the most frequent value (mode) observed in each respective column.
   - By leveraging the mode of each column, we ensure that missing values are replaced with the most common values, maintaining data consistency and preserving the distribution of values.

#### Outlier Analysis

To gain deeper insights into the dataset's characteristics, we conducted outlier analysis using dendrograms and box plots.

1. **Dendrograms**:
   - Dendrograms are hierarchical clustering diagrams that visualize the relationships between data points.
   - By constructing dendrograms, we identified hierarchical clusters of data points, enabling the detection of potential outliers.
   - Outliers may manifest as data points with distinctively long branches in the dendrogram or as isolated clusters.

2. **Box Plots**:
   - Box plots provide a graphical representation of the dataset's distribution, including measures such as median, quartiles, and outliers.
   - We utilized box plots to visually inspect the spread of data and identify any observations that fall significantly outside the interquartile range (IQR).
   - Outliers in box plots are typically represented as points beyond the whiskers, indicating data points that lie beyond 1.5 times the IQR above the upper quartile or below the lower quartile.

The visualizations offer a concise overview of electric vehicle (EV) types and car makes. The first plot presents a bar chart and pie chart showcasing the distribution of EV types, highlighting the count of vehicles for each type and their proportional representation. The second visualization focuses on the count of cars by make, depicted through a horizontal bar plot indicating the production count for each car manufacturer.

#### Interactive Electric Vehicle Dashboard

This Dash app visualizes various aspects of electric vehicle data, allowing users to explore relationships between different features. Users can select features from dropdown menus to generate scatter plots, histograms, pie charts, bar graphs, box plots, line plots, area plots, and heatmaps. The app leverages Dask for efficient data loading and processing, making it suitable for large datasets.

#### Feature Selection

Feature selection plays a pivotal role in constructing predictive models, particularly in crime analysis, where the right features can bolster accuracy and interpretability,

 while redundant or irrelevant features can impede model performance. A comprehensive feature selection process entails various techniques, such as correlation analysis, mutual information, and recursive feature elimination, to discern the most informative features for predicting crime types. This ensures that the chosen features align with the model's objectives and contribute substantively to its predictive power.

To navigate the feature selection process effectively, we utilize techniques such as correlation analysis, mutual information, and recursive feature elimination. By discerning the most informative features, we ensure that our models focus on relevant attributes, thereby enhancing predictive accuracy and interpretability.

- **Correlation Analysis**:
  - **Correlation Heatmap**: To visualize the correlation matrix of numerical features, enabling the identification of highly correlated pairs.
  - **Pairwise Scatter Plots**: For visual examination of relationships between numerical features, aiding in detecting patterns and collinearity.
  - **Feature Importance**: Utilizing techniques such as Random Forests or Gradient Boosting to rank features based on their contribution to the target variable.

- **Mutual Information**:
  - **Mutual Information Scores**: Calculating mutual information scores between features and the target variable to gauge the amount of shared information.
  - **Top Features**: Selecting features with the highest mutual information scores, ensuring the inclusion of informative attributes.

- **Recursive Feature Elimination**:
  - **Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE)**: Iteratively removing the least important features based on model performance, ultimately identifying the optimal subset.
  - **Cross-Validation**: Employing cross-validation to assess model performance during feature elimination, ensuring robustness.

#### Future Predictions using ARIMA and Polynomial Regression

Future predictions of electric vehicle production entail leveraging the ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) model and Polynomial Regression, enabling accurate forecasts based on historical data. The ARIMA model, particularly adept at time series forecasting, incorporates autoregressive and moving average components to capture temporal dependencies and trends in electric vehicle production. Simultaneously, Polynomial Regression enhances the predictive framework by fitting a polynomial equation to the data, capturing nonlinear relationships and trends in electric vehicle production.

The predictive process begins with ARIMA, where the historical production data is decomposed into its constituent components. ARIMA models account for autoregressive terms (past values), differencing (removing trends), and moving averages (past forecast errors). This approach allows us to identify the best-fitting ARIMA model through techniques like the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and conduct model diagnostics to ensure robustness.

In tandem, Polynomial Regression offers a complementary perspective, capturing nonlinear trends in electric vehicle production. By fitting polynomial equations of varying degrees to the historical data, we capture intricate patterns that linear models might miss. Cross-validation is employed to prevent overfitting and identify the optimal polynomial degree.

Combining the ARIMA and Polynomial Regression approaches yields a robust predictive framework. Ensemble techniques, such as weighted averaging, enhance prediction accuracy by integrating the strengths of both models. The result is a comprehensive forecast, guiding stakeholders in strategic planning and decision-making within the evolving electric vehicle market.
